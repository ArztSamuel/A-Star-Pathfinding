# A-Star-Pathfinding
Programs and source code for demonstrating the A-Star Pathfinding Algorithm

This repository holds different programs and their source code for demonstrating how the A* Algorithm works.

Currently there are 2 programs included:

- 	/Java Visiualisation:
	A java program that visually demonstrates the Algorithm either step by step or by instantly finding the fastest path. 
	It can be controlled with the space bar/enter and the mouse. Obstacles and the start/target position of the path may be placed by the user.
	(Currently only available in german, should not really matter though.)
	
-	/C-Sharp Demo:
	A C# demo program that is available in source code form that utilises the A*-Algorithm. 
	The algorithm itself can be found inside the A-Star class in its FindPath method.
	There are also individual classes for the field in which the path is searched, as well as the Open List, which
	is utilized with a binary heap.
	
	
You can also find the slides I have used in my videos in /Slides.


I explain the basics of the algorithm in these videos:
